Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you donâ€™t already have a GitHub account, go to GitHub and sign up for a free account.

Step 2: Create a New Repository
Log in to GitHub.
Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
Name your repository. If you want to create a personal website, you should name it as username.github.io, replacing username with your GitHub username.
Add a description (optional).
Choose Public.
Check "Initialize this repository with a README" (optional).
Click "Create repository".
Step 3: Create Your Website Files
You can create a simple HTML file for your website.

Click on "Add file" > "Create new file".

Name your file index.html (this will be the main page of your website).

In the text editor, you can write a simple HTML structure. For example:

html

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Run
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My GitHub Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Page!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple website hosted on GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
Scroll down and add a commit message, then click "Commit new file".

Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to the Settings tab of your repository.
Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the sidebar.
Under "Source", select the branch you want to use (usually main) and the folder (typically / (root)).
Click "Save".
Step 5: Access Your Website
After a few minutes, your website will be available at https://username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username). You can visit this URL in your web browser to see your new website.

Step 6: Make Changes
To update your website:

Go back to your repository.
Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., index.html).
Click the pencil icon to edit the file.
Make your changes, add a commit message, and click "Commit changes".
Step 7: Explore Further
You can add more HTML files, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
You can also use Jekyll, a static site generator, for more complex websites. GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box.
